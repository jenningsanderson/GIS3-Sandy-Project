_This project will look at all of the Geo-Coded tweets from Hurricane Sandy_


##About
Somewhere on order of 1% of tweets are geo-tagged.  That is, the metadata of the tweet includes the lat/long of the location from which the tweet was sent.


##Movation
What can be learned from using a person's Twitter activity over the course of Superstorm Sandy as a proxy for their location?

##Datasets
1. ~300,000 geo-coded tweets
2. Storm data from USGS?
3. Build-Environment Information from OpenStreetMap


##Timeline
This project aims to be finished by the end of April, 2014
